This project provides an interactive SQL  environment that runs entirely in the browser using **sql.js**. It loads a SQLite database from a configurable URL, provides a query editor, displays results, and checks correctness using JavaScript-based tests. The interface uses **React-Bootstrap** and supports **Bootswatch themes** defined in the config file. It also includes an optional **image pane** that can show one or more images, with resizing and carousel support.
